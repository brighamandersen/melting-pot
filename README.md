# melting-pot

Facial recognition app for embracing your ancestral roots!

In BYU CS 356 UI Design class we were given a project to design an app that would help the Coloured people of South Africa. We did extensive research on the country and discovered that it has become a melting pot of diverse races and cultures. A big group of people there are the Coloured, who often find themselves on the fringes. After hearing lots of interviews of everyday people, it sounded like their main concern they needed was a sense of belonging. Their backgrounds were so fragmented across different cultures that it was hard to even know who their tribal group was, let alone connect with them. This app design set out to use facial recognition so that these South Africans could scan their face and then see where their different features came from, thus helping them bridge that gap and understand their roots. The scope of this project was just app designs and not the code itself. These designs were created using Figma.

For a complete set of app design screenshots and more in-depth explanations on the research process, see the [design final writeup](./melting-pot-final-design-writeup.pdf).
